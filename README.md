# bandit-speical-threshold

This repository holds the code for the mod **BanditSpecialThresholdDisplay**.
> A Risk of Rain 2 mod that adds a HP threshold to kill an enemy with Bandit's special.

### Notes
This is a makeshift mod to serve as an alternative to the deprecated [BanditHPThresholdDisplay](https://thunderstore.io/package/TheMysticSword/BanditHPThresholdDisplay/). As this was made for my own personal use, I have yet to fully flesh out this mod with features (such as customisable colours), as well as having yet to fully account for things like buffs (including Desperado's effect).

You are more than welcome to contribute.
